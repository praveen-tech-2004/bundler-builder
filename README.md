# Bundle Builder UI

This is a static "Bundle Builder" UI project, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It recreates the user experience of a custom product bundling section, similar to those found on e-commerce platforms like Shopify.

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development by building a responsive, dynamic UI without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.

- **Interactive "Add to Bundle" Buttons**: Each product card has a toggle button that changes its state (text and icon) when clicked.
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: A sticky sidebar on desktop that tracks the selected products.
- **Progressive UI**: The sidebar shows the progress of the bundle, guiding the user to select the required number of items.
- **Real-time Calculations**: The subtotal and a 30% discount are automatically calculated and displayed when three or more products are added.
- **Interactive CTA Button**: The "Add Bundle to Cart" button is only enabled when the bundle requirements are met.
- **Quantity Stepper**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of selected items directly within the sidebar.
- **Remove Items**: Items can be removed from the bundle list in the sidebar.
