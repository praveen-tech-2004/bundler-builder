# Bundle Builder UI

This is a static "Bundle Builder" UI project, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It recreates the user experience of a custom product bundling section, similar to those found on e-commerce platforms like Shopify.

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development by building a responsive, dynamic UI without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.
